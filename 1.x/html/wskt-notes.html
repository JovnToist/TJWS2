<h2>TJWS Websocket (JSR 356) extension module version 1.0 alpha </h2>
<h3>Release notes</h3>
<p>This is first release of JSR 356 implementation in scope of TJWS. The implementation is provided as TJWS extension module and 
generally optional. It introduces extra dependency as fast classpath scan library which is used for end points deployment. The library
 is forked at <a href="https://github.com/drogatkin/fast-classpath-scanner">GitHub</a>. 7Bee scripts are provided in the fork. End points
 deployment is provided only in scope of J2EE deployed applications. The limitation can be reconsidered in future. Since websockets
 use non blocking IO, they work only with SelectorAcceptor acceptor. 
</p>
