<h2>TJWS Websocket (JSR 356) extension module version 1.0 alpha </h2>
<h3>Release notes</h3>
<p>This is first release of JSR 356 implementation in scope of TJWS. The implementation is provided as TJWS extension module and 
generally optional. It introduces extra dependency as fast classpath scan library which is used for end points deployment. The library
 is forked at <a href="https://github.com/drogatkin/fast-classpath-scanner">GitHub</a>. 7Bee scripts are provided in the fork. End points
 deployment is provided only in scope of .war deployed applications. The limitation can be reconsidered in future. Since websockets
 use non blocking IO, they work only with SelectorAcceptor acceptor. Error code SC_NOT_IMPLEMENTED (501) will be returned
 at handshake for other types of acceptors.
</p>
<h3>Known problems and limitations</h3>
<ol>
<li>No SSL support</li>
<li>No extensions processing and negotiation</li>
<li>No idle timeout yet</li>
<li>Debug messages are not cleaned completely from log</li>
</ol>
<h3>Build Notes</h3>
<p>If you prefer build everything yourself, for example for specific Java version, you need also obtain source code of JSR 356 API.
Use the command: <code>svn checkout https://svn.java.net/svn/websocket-spec~source-code-repository</code>, 7Bee build scripts for 
the API can be obtained from <a href="https://github.com/drogatkin/7Bee/tree/master/examples/jsr356api">examples/jsr356api</a> of 7Bee distribution.
